https://michiganelections.io/docs/ - for API sauce

This is an attempt at putting a front end ballot mimic face on the elections-api so that
users can pre-view their ballots prior to going out an voting - increasing voter education,
communication, and participation.

Ideas for future:
    modify API call based on user input that determines their specific voting location
